# 02: UI/UX Plan (Mobile MVP)

**High Priority:** The immediate goal is to make the existing application fully responsive and usable on mobile devices.

### **Tasks:**

1.  **Responsive Layout Refactor:**
    - **[Task]** Use CSS media queries to create a single-column layout for mobile viewports.
    - **[Task]** Adjust font sizes, margins, and padding for better readability on small screens.

2.  **Mobile Navigation:**
    - **[Task]** Replace the top-right button cluster with a single "hamburger" menu icon.
    - **[Task]** Create an off-canvas or full-screen menu that contains the controls (Mode, Seed, Share, etc.).

3.  **Control Adjustments:**
    - **[Task]** Ensure all controls, especially the `speed` slider, are easily tappable and usable on touch devices.
    - **[Task]** Verify that touch interactions on the canvas (for disturbing particles) work as expected.

4.  **Modals and Panels:**
    - **[Task]** Ensure the `Help` modal and the `Lab` and `Bookmarks` panels are styled correctly and are fully functional on mobile.

5.  **Testing:**
    - **[Task]** Perform rigorous testing on various mobile devices (or emulators) to identify and fix layout or interaction issues.
