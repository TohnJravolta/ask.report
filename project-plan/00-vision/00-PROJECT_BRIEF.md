# Project Brief: ask.report

**Project:** ask.report - Generative Art AI Interface & Knowledge Tool

**Vision:** Create a minimalist, AI-powered knowledge tool wrapped in an ambient, generative art experience. The interface will be a symbiotic relationship between the user, the AI, and a real-time WebGL particle simulation that visualizes the "novelty" of information.

**Core Features:**
- **Generative WebGL Background:** A high-performance particle simulation that reacts to user interaction and data.
- **AI Query Interface:** A clean, central interface for users to ask questions and receive AI-generated reports.
- **Novelty Engine:** A system that measures the chaotic state of the particle simulation and influences the UI's accent color.

**Key Milestones:**
1.  **MVP (1 Month):** Achieve full mobile-first responsiveness for the existing application.
2.  **v1 (3-6 Months):** Integrate a live AI backend for the query interface.
