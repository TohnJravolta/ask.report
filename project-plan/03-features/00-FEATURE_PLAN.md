# 03: Feature Plan

## MVP (Mobile-First Focus)

- No new features will be added for the MVP. The focus is solely on the UI/UX refactor for mobile responsiveness.

## V1 (AI Backend Integration)

- **AI Query Functionality:**
  - **[Task]** Implement the frontend logic to send user queries to the `/api/query` endpoint.
  - **[Task]** Create a loading/thinking state in the UI to indicate that a query is in progress.
  - **[Task]** Display the AI-generated report in the results panel.
  - **[Task]** Implement a "Copy" button to capture the response text.

- **Visual Feedback:**
  - **[Task]** Enhance the WebGL simulation to react to the AI query lifecycle (e.g., a visual pulse when the query is sent, increased activity while waiting for a response).
