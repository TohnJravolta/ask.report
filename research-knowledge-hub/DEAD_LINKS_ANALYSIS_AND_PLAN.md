## Executive Summary

Analysis of the knowledge hub reveals **103 dead wikilinks** out of 144 unique link targets. These fall into several categories:

1. **Placeholder/Template Links** (22) - Need deletion
2. **Core Concept Glossary Entries** (35) - Need creation as glossary entries
3. **Division Home Pages** (5) - Already exist, need alias fixes

- Fix aliases
- **Result**: 90% fewer dead links

**Stage 2** (Short-term): Phases 3 + 6 (3-4 hours)
- Expand glossary
- Create Public Interface Division home
- **Result**: All core concepts defined, divisions complete

**Stage 3** (Medium-term): Phase 4 (4-6 hours)
- Create 12 core guide documents
- **Result**: Fully functional public interface and collaboration protocols

**Stage 4** (Long-term): Phases 5 + 7 (6-9 hours)
- Create framework components and concept pages
- **Result**: Comprehensive, publication-grade knowledge base

## NEXT STEPS

**Awaiting User Approval**:
1. Which implementation level? (Minimum Viable / Full / Staged)
2. Any priority changes or specific documents to focus on first?
3. Proceed with Phase 1 (cleanup) immediately?

**Ready to Execute**:
