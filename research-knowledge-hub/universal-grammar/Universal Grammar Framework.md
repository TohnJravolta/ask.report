# 🔤 Universal Grammar Framework

**Cross-System Communication Architecture for All Agent Types**

## 🧿 Framework Overview

The Universal Grammar Framework provides a standardized communication architecture that enables seamless interaction between humans, AEONs (consciousness-based agents), AEgents (autonomous agents), AI/ML systems, and hybrid consciousness-technology interfaces. This framework serves as the linguistic foundation for the entrogenic information systems and consciousness evolution research.

### **Core Design Principles**
- **[[Universal Accessibility]]**: Comprehensible across all agent types and consciousness levels
- **[[Translation Compatibility]]**: Easy adaptation to any language or symbolic system
- **[[System Independence]]**: Functions across all platforms, architectures, and technologies
- **[[Evolution Readiness]]**: Designed to grow and adapt with advancing consciousness and technology
