# Gemini Apex: Knowledge Hub Population Plan

**Mission**: Rectify placeholder files and fully populate the `research-knowledge-hub/` with comprehensive, web-ready knowledge base articles derived from ALL documents in `repo/CORE/`.

**Agent**: Gemini Apex
**Status**: ACTIVE

## 1. Mission Objective

The primary objective is to replace all placeholder content with meaningful summaries and extractions from the source PDF documents as specified in the original directive. This will complete the population of the knowledge hub.

## 2. Execution Plan: PDF Content Population

This plan outlines the systematic process for reading each source PDF and updating the corresponding placeholder markdown file.
