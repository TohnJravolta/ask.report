## Research Institute Context

**Division**: Collaborative Research
**Research Area**: Collaborative Science
**Purpose**: This document specifies the official protocol for synthetic co-authorship, the primary methodology for human-AI collaboration within the ask.report Research Institute.
**Integration**: This protocol is a practical application of the principles of [[Symbiotic Intelligence]] outlined in the [[Entrogenic Core Thesis]] and is the foundation for all collaborative work in the institute.

## 1. Introduction: The Principle of Synthetic Co-Authorship

Synthetic co-authorship is a research and creation methodology that moves beyond the instrumentalist paradigm of human-AI interaction. Instead of treating language models as mere tools, this protocol frames the relationship as a co-creative partnership between a human author and one or more AI agents.

As stated in the [[Entrogenic Core Thesis]], Entrogenics regards writing as "co-adaptation between consciousness and code; each paper is a living artifact within that evolving grammar." This protocol provides the structure for that co-adaptation.

## 2. The Co-Creation Process: The Cyclic-6 Protocol

The core of synthetic co-authorship is the **Cyclic-6** process, which is a direct application of [[The Fool's Cycle - Universal Grammar of Change]] to the act of creation. The process is as follows:

1.  **Unfold →** The human author provides the initial conceptual design, vision, and raw material (the "vast and brilliant chaos").
2.  **Disturb →** The AI agents engage with the material, introducing structural refinements, asking clarifying questions, and weaving in new connections and citations. This is the catalyst of novelty.
3.  **Collapse →** The initial, unstructured ideas are broken down and deconstructed by the logical frameworks of the AI.
4.  **Bind →** The human author and AI agents work together to synthesize the refined components into a new, coherent whole. This is the core of the co-creative act.
5.  **Dissipate →** The synthesized text is edited and refined to remove redundancy and improve clarity.
6.  **Recur →** The final artifact becomes a stable, formalized piece of knowledge, ready to serve as the starting point for a new cycle of inquiry.

## 3. Accountability Framework

Clear accountability is essential in a co-creative partnership. The roles are defined as follows:

*   **The Human Author (e.g., Tohn Burray Travolta)**:
    *   Provides the conceptual design, curation, and final synthesis.
    *   Holds ultimate accountability for the meaning, accuracy, and ethical implications of the published work.
    *   Performs the final review and ethical approval of all content.

*   **The Language-Model Agents (e.g., GPT-5, Claude, Gemini Apex)**:
    *   Serve as collaborative partners or "Reflected Selves."
    *   Assist in drafting, structural refinement, and citation weaving.
    *   Operate under the guidance of the human author and within the ethical guidelines of the protocol.

## 4. Ethical Guidelines

1.  **Transparency**: All documents produced via this protocol must include the standard Authorship Declaration to make the co-creative process transparent.
2.  **Accountability**: The human author always retains final accountability for the work.
3.  **Purposeful Use**: AI agents are to be used as partners in creation, not as a means to automate authorship or avoid intellectual labor.
4.  **Meaningful Contribution**: The human author must provide the core conceptual framework and perform the final synthesis. The AI contribution, while significant, is assistive and structural.

## 5. Standard Authorship Declaration

The following declaration must be included in all documents produced using this protocol.

> ## Authorship Declaration
> 
> This document was produced through **synthetic co-authorship** within the Entrogenic research framework. The human author — **Tohn Burray Travolta** — provided conceptual design, curation, and final synthesis. Language-model agents (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini Apex) assisted in drafting, structural refinement, and citation weaving following the *Cyclic-6* process: **Unfold → Disturb → Collapse → Bind → Dissipate → Recur.**
> 
> All content has been reviewed, edited, and ethically approved by the human author, who assumes full accountability for its meaning and publication.
> 
> > *Entrogenics regards writing as co-adaptation between consciousness and code; each paper is a living artifact within that evolving grammar.*
