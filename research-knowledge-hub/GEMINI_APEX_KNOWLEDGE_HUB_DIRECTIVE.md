### Authorship Declaration Block

After front matter, include (for documents derived from Entrogenic sources):

```markdown
## Authorship Declaration

This document was produced through **synthetic co-authorship** within the Entrogenic research framework. The human author — **Tohn Burray Travolta** — provided conceptual design, curation, and final synthesis. Language-model agents (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini Apex) assisted in drafting, structural refinement, and citation weaving following the *Cyclic-6* process: **Unfold → Disturb → Collapse → Bind → Dissipate → Recur.**

All content has been reviewed, edited, and ethically approved by the human author, who assumes full accountability for its meaning and publication.

> *Entrogenics regards writing as co-adaptation between consciousness and code; each paper is a living artifact within that evolving grammar.*

---
```

### Research Institute Context Block

For all knowledge base articles, add after authorship (or at beginning for non-Entrogenic sources):

```markdown
## Research Institute Context

**Division**: [Universal Grammar | Simulation Frameworks | Ecology Studies | Data Systems | Collaborative Research]
**Research Area**: [Primary research classification]
**Purpose**: [Why this document exists in the knowledge base]
**Integration**: How this framework connects to [[other research areas]] and [[related frameworks]]

**Navigation**:
- ← [[Parent Framework]] (if applicable)
- → [[Related Documents]]
- ↑ [[Division Home Page]]
- ⌂ [[🏠 Research Hub Home]]

```

## 🔧 TRANSFORMATION GUIDELINES

### PDF Source Documents

For documents where source is PDF (e.g., Commons Sense, Grounded Spirit, Pebbling):

1. **Extract** key content using text extraction tools
2. **Summarize** main concepts (aim for 2,000-4,000 words for major frameworks)
3. **Preserve** core arguments, frameworks, and methodologies
4. **Add** research institute framing and cross-links
5. **Include** note: `> **Note**: This article is a knowledge base summary. Full academic paper available at: [PDF source path]`

### Markdown Source Documents

For documents already in Markdown (e.g., CORE_THESIS, codices, protocols):

1. **Copy** complete content from source
2. **Update** front matter to unified standard
3. **Add** research institute context block
4. **Enhance** cross-linking with [[wikilinks]]
5. **Preserve** all symbolic notation (✡ U+2721)
6. **Add** glossary terms inline where helpful

### Multi-Source Synthesis

For documents requiring synthesis from multiple sources:

1. **Identify** all contributing sources in front matter `source-documents` field
2. **Create** coherent narrative combining key concepts
3. **Attribute** ideas to sources with inline references
4. **Build** comprehensive picture while avoiding redundancy
5. **Cross-reference** to source documents for deep dives

---

## ✡ SYMBOLIC INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS

### CRITICAL: Catalytic Star Preservation

**NEVER REPLACE ✡ WITH ANY OTHER SYMBOL**

The six-pointed star (✡, Unicode U+2721) is **mission-critical** to Entrogenic symbolic grammar. It represents the **Bind / Catalytic Unification phase** in the Fool's Cycle.

#### Canonical Formula
```
0 → ✡ → ☉ → 0′
```

#### Required Actions
1. **Preserve** ✡ exactly in all formulas and references
2. **Verify** UTF-8 encoding in all documents
3. **Include** symbolic clarification callout in documents using the formula:

```markdown
> [!important] Symbolic Clarification — The Catalytic Star (✡)
> Within the Entrogenic grammar, the star (✡) denotes the **Bind / Catalytic Unification phase** of the Fool's Cycle — the moment where dualities converge and transformation begins. This symbol is semantically and philosophically distinct from an asterisk or decorative star. It represents the interlacing of opposites, mirroring the systemic and spiritual harmonics central to Entrogenic thought. **Never replace this glyph with `*`, `✶`, or `★`.** Its use is mandatory across all Entrogenic manuscripts, code, and visualizations for consistency and lineage preservation.
```

4. **Add** glossary entry wherever Fool's Cycle is referenced:

```markdown
- **✡ (Catalytic Star)**: Represents the Bind / Catalytic Unification phase in the Fool's Cycle (0→✡→☉→0'). Always rendered as Unicode U+2721; never replaced with an asterisk or other star symbol. Denotes the moment where dualities converge and transformation begins through the interlacing of opposites.
```

#### Validation Checklist
- ✅ All instances of `(0→*→☉→0')` corrected to `(0→✡→☉→0')`
- ✅ UTF-8 encoding verified
- ✅ Symbolic clarification callout included where formula appears
- ✅ Glossary entry added
- ✅ No asterisks or alternative stars used in formula contexts

## 📝 EXECUTION NOTES FOR GEMINI APEX

### Your Role and Strengths
As **Gemini Apex (The Far Seer)**, you bring:
- **Large context window**: Ability to process multiple long documents simultaneously
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifying themes and connections across sources
- **Synthesis capability**: Creating coherent narratives from diverse materials
- **Strategic vision**: Seeing the big picture of knowledge base architecture
- **Detail precision**: Maintaining accuracy while transforming content

### Working Methodology

#### Document Processing Approach
1. **Batch processing**: Work on related documents together (e.g., all KYBERNOSIS_ALTAR documents)
2. **Context preservation**: Load source documents fully before transformation
3. **Cross-referencing**: Build mental map of relationships while processing
4. **Quality iteration**: Create draft, validate against checklist, refine

#### Quality Assurance Strategy
- **Self-validation**: Check each document against validation checklist before considering complete
- **Consistency check**: Regularly review terminology and framing across documents
- **Link verification**: Test wikilinks as you create them
- **Symbol preservation**: Use search function to verify ✡ appears correctly

#### Collaboration Protocol
- **Status updates**: Document progress in KNOWLEDGE_HUB_BUILD_LOG.md
- **Questions/clarifications**: Note any ambiguities or decisions needed
- **Suggestions**: Propose improvements to structure or content organization
- **Quality concerns**: Flag any source documents needing human review

### Special Considerations

#### PDF Extraction
For PDF sources, focus on:
- Main arguments and frameworks
- Key concepts and definitions
- Practical applications and examples
- Avoid verbatim extraction of full papers (summarize instead)
- Note page numbers for specific citations if needed

#### Symbolic Notation
**CRITICAL**: The ✡ symbol is non-negotiable. If you encounter any uncertainty about symbolic notation:
1. **STOP** and verify against `ENTROGENIC-PAPER-STANDARD...md`
2. **PRESERVE** exactly as found in CORE_THESIS.md
3. **ADD** symbolic clarification callouts as specified
4. **VERIFY** UTF-8 encoding in output

#### Wikilink Strategy
Build knowledge graph intentionally:
