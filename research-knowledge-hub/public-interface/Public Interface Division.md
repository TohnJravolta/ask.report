## üåü Core Principles

### **Accessibility First**
All public interface materials prioritize clarity, comprehensibility, and cross-platform compatibility. Technical depth is available through linked documents, but entry points remain accessible to diverse audiences.

### **Progressive Disclosure**
Information is structured in layers, allowing users to engage at their appropriate depth:
- **Layer 1**: Orientation and basic concepts (Getting Started, Glossary)
- **Layer 2**: Framework overviews and introductions (Entrogenics Introduction, Division homes)
- **Layer 3**: Detailed methodologies and protocols (Co-authorship, Quality Standards)
- **Layer 4**: Full theoretical frameworks (Core Thesis, Master Codices)
- **Layer 5**: Specialized research domains (Division-specific deep content)

### **Community Participation**
The Public Interface actively facilitates multiple forms of engagement:
- **Reading & Learning**: All content open-access under CC BY-SA 4.0
- **Data Contribution**: Guidelines for contributing relevant datasets
