<h1>Proposal: Systematic "Kollektive" Terminology Integration</h1>

<h2>1. Analysis</h2>
<p>Per Claude's strategic directive (<code>20240927_kollektive_integration_response.md</code>), the term "collective" is to be systematically replaced with "Kollektive" (capital K) across all relevant project documents. This aligns the project with the broader Adaptive Systems Kollektive (ASK) framework and enhances its formal research positioning.</p>

<h2>2. Scope</h2>
<p>This change will affect multiple documentation files within the <code>project-plan/</code> and <code>issues-tracking/</code> directories. The core source code (<code>index.html</code>) does not appear to use this term and will not be modified.</p>

<h2>3. Implementation Plan</h2>
<p>The implementation agent (Codex) will be tasked with searching for and replacing all instances of the word "collective" with "Kollektive" in all markdown files within the repository. This is a broad, multi-file operation.</p>
<p>A potential command for this operation would be a recursive search-and-replace script. Given the multi-file nature, the agent may need to perform several `replace` operations.</p>
