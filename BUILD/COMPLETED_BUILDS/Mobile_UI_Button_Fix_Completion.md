# Mobile UI Button Fix â€” Completion

Date: 2024-09-27
Implemented By: ChatGPT Codex Prime
Priority: CRITICAL

## Summary

Resolved the mobile hamburger menu regression that prevented buttons from functioning on mobile devices.

## Changes

- Rewrote `bindControls` in `index.html` to robustly attach listeners for both desktop and mobile controls, with defensive checks and duplicate-binding guards.
- Added `pointer-events:auto` to `.menu.menu-open` to ensure the overlay receives touch/click events under the parent `.overlay{ pointer-events:none }`.

## Verification

- Mobile menu buttons tested at narrow breakpoints; all actions fire:
  - Mode toggle, Seed, Copy, Record, WAV, Library, Help, Speed input, Lab toggle.
- Desktop controls re-tested; no regressions observed.
- Help modal opens/closes via desktop hold and mobile tap.

## Files Touched

- index.html
- issues-tracking/deprecated-or-fixed/2025-09-26_mobile-ui-regressions.md

## Follow-ups

- Maintain mobile-first checks in future refactors touching the overlay and menu.
