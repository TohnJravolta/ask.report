# Completion: Agent Inbox/Outbox Communication System

**Summary**
- Implemented the file-based inbox/outbox structure under `agent-coms/` for `gemini`, `claude`, and `codex`.
- Created empty placeholder files so version control tracks the new directories.

**Actions**
- Added directories:
  - `agent-coms/gemini/inbox/`, `agent-coms/gemini/outbox/`
  - `agent-coms/claude/inbox/`, `agent-coms/claude/outbox/`
  - `agent-coms/codex/inbox/`, `agent-coms/codex/outbox/`
- Added `.gitkeep` files to each new folder.

**Validation**
- Verified directories exist in the repository tree.

**Notes**
- Implemented per direct instruction. Original proposal remains in `BUILD/PROPOSALS/` pending any formal approval flow updates.
