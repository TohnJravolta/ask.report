# SSG Cyclic Development Workflow Integration

**Framework**: SuperSomethingGames Cyclic Development Ecosystem
**Implementation**: BUILD Pipeline Transformation from Linear to Adaptive Cycles
**Version**: 1.0
**Integration Scope**: ask.report + iasis.quest + Future SSG Projects

## Overview: Linear to Cyclic Transformation

The traditional BUILD pipeline has been transformed from a linear PROPOSALS → APPROVED_BUILDS → COMPLETED_BUILDS workflow into a sophisticated 6-phase cyclic development ecosystem that enables continuous learning, adaptation, and mobile-first excellence.

### **Traditional Linear Flow (Deprecated)**
```
PROPOSALS → APPROVED_BUILDS → COMPLETED_BUILDS
```

### **Enhanced Cyclic Flow (Active)**
