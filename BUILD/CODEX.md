## Inbox/Outbox Messaging Protocols (Codex)

Purpose:
- Use `agent-coms/<agent>/{inbox,outbox}` for concise, actionable coordination.

Use cases (Codex):
- Notify Claude of implementation starts/completions and artifact moves
- Request clarifications that block implementation or validation
- Coordinate cross-system impacts (decisions, issues, project-plan)
- Confirm quality gate results and request sign-off

Message rules:
- Filename: `YYYYMMDD_<topic>.md` with clear owner and action
- Place message in the target agentâ€™s `inbox/` and copy to `agent-coms/codex/outbox/`
- Include concrete paths and proposal IDs; keep scope single-action
- Clear `outbox/` after receiver confirms completion

Integration with BUILD:
- When promoting proposals or completing implementations, message Claude with a brief summary and links to:
  - Source proposal (`BUILD/PROPOSALS/...` or `BUILD/APPROVED_BUILDS/...`)
  - Completion record(s) under `BUILD/COMPLETED_BUILDS/`
- For blockers or ambiguities in approved specs, message Claude for resolution; for strategy shifts, message Gemini
 - Use the standard message structure in `agent-coms/message-template.md`
