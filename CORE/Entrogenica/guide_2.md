# üúÇ GUIDE_2.md ‚Äî Finalization Protocol for CORE_THESIS_FULL
### For use by Gemini CLI or compatible editing agents

## Purpose
This guide instructs the agent to finalize, repair, and unify both the **Markdown** and **HTML** versions of  
the Entrogenic Core Thesis found in:
```

repo/CORE/Entrogenica/CORE/

````
The goal is to produce a *publication-ready* dual-format document ‚Äî one Markdown file for the Obsidian vault and one HTML page for public web viewing ‚Äî preserving all canonical Entrogenic standards.

---

## Primary Inputs
- `CORE_THESIS_FULL.md`  ‚Üê main source text (Markdown)
- `CORE_THESIS_FULL.html` ‚Üê web version generated by Gemini
- `citation-stubs.md` (if present) or extracted citations section
- `core-theme.css` (do not modify beyond style verification)

---

## Core Objectives
1. **Preserve all text and structure.**  
   Do *not rewrite* or remove existing sections unless required for consistency.  
   The agent is repairing formatting, verifying citations, and enforcing Entrogenic style.

2. **Unify both versions.**  
   - The Markdown document is the *master* version.  
   - The HTML page must render identically in structure and content.  
   - Fix any mismatched formatting, section titles, paragraph breaks, or symbol rendering.

3. **Ensure publication-grade quality.**  
   - Verify citations, front matter, glossary, and references.  
   - Confirm UTF-8 encoding and visual integrity of symbols, especially the ‚ú° glyph.  
   - Validate that Obsidian and GitHub Pages both parse the Markdown cleanly.

---

## Specific Tasks

### 1. Front Matter
- Insert the **Entrogenic Paper Standard header** exactly at the top of the Markdown file.  
- Confirm that all fields (`title`, `author`, `series`, `license`, etc.) are accurate.  
- Copy metadata into the `<head>` of the HTML file as `<meta>` tags.

### 2. Symbolic Fidelity
- Search the entire Markdown and HTML for `*`, `‚ú∂`, or `‚òÖ` used in the Fool‚Äôs Cycle formula.  
- Replace them with **‚ú° (U+2721)** ‚Äî the canonical ‚ÄúCatalytic Star.‚Äù  
- At first occurrence of the formula, insert this block verbatim:

  > **Symbolic Clarification ‚Äî The Catalytic Star (‚ú°)**  
  > In Entrogenic grammar, the ‚ú° symbol denotes the **Bind / Catalytic Unification phase** of the Fool‚Äôs Cycle:  
  > ```
  > 0 ‚Üí ‚ú° ‚Üí ‚òâ ‚Üí 0‚Ä≤
  > ```
  > It must never be replaced with `*`, `‚ú∂`, or `‚òÖ`. Always encoded as Unicode U+2721.

- Add a matching glossary entry under ‚Äú‚ú° ‚Äî Catalytic Star.‚Äù

### 3. Citation Integrity
- Cross-check every in-text citation `[Stub ##]` with `citation-stubs.md`.  
- If any are missing, create consistent placeholders and flag them at the end in a short ‚ÄúCitation Audit‚Äù section.  
- Ensure the References list matches all in-text citations.  
- Format all references in APA7 style.  
- Confirm URLs and DOIs resolve correctly.

### 4. Formatting and Structure
- Use proper Markdown heading levels (`#`, `##`, `###`).  
- Verify line breaks, blockquotes, and callouts render correctly in both Obsidian and GitHub Pages.  
- Ensure consistent indentation for tables, code blocks, and glossary entries.  
- Check that all Unicode symbols (‚ú°, ‚òâ, etc.) render correctly ‚Äî no HTML escapes or question boxes.

### 5. HTML Validation
- Validate the HTML page:
  - Add `<meta charset="UTF-8">` in the `<head>`.  
  - Confirm `core-theme.css` loads locally; no external resources.  
  - Fix any broken anchors or ToC links.  
  - Add a build footer comment:
    ```
    <!-- build: CORE_THESIS_FULL.md ‚Üí CORE_THESIS_FULL.html; verified: UTF-8; wordcount=####; stubs=## -->
    ```

### 6. Obsidian Optimization
- Check that the Markdown file:
  - Opens cleanly in Obsidian without warnings.  
  - Uses only supported Markdown features (no raw HTML except for embedded meta tags).  
  - Retains the YAML header intact.  
  - Uses `[[]]` wikilinks for internal Entrogenic documents.

## Deliverables
After completion, the folder must contain:
````

repo/CORE/Entrogenica/CORE/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CORE_THESIS_FULL.md        # Final master version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CORE_THESIS_FULL.html       # Themed, publication-ready HTML
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core-theme.css              # Verified CSS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ citation-stubs.md           # Updated citation ledger
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ glossary.md (optional copy)

```

---

## Output Summary (requested from agent)
At the end of its run, the agent must produce a short report appended as a comment block or returned separately:
```

=== CORE THESIS FINALIZATION REPORT ===
Symbol replacements (‚ú°): ##
Citations checked: ##
Missing citations: ##
HTML validation: Pass/Fail
Obsidian validation: Pass/Fail
Additional notes: [...]
=======================

```

---

## Notes for Gemini CLI Execution
Run with both Markdown and HTML files as context:
```

gemini run --model=2.5-pro 
--context-files repo/CORE/Entrogenica/CORE/CORE_THESIS_FULL.md repo/CORE/Entrogenica/CORE/CORE_THESIS_FULL.html guide_2.md 
--max_output_tokens=24000 --multi-output 
--temperature=0.2 
--prompt 'Repair and finalize the Entrogenic Core Thesis as specified in guide_2.md'

```

Gemini should operate in **repair mode**, not creative mode ‚Äî preserving authorial tone, correcting only structure, references, and formatting fidelity.

---

### Quality Targets
- 100 % symbol consistency (`‚ú°` everywhere).
- 100 % citation cross-matching between body and ledger.
- 0 broken links or invalid HTML tags.
- Clean Markdown rendering in Obsidian and GitHub Pages.
- Full compliance with Entrogenic Paper Standard and ethical co-authorship statement.
