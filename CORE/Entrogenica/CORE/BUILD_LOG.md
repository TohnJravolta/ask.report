## Sections Requiring Future Human Review

1. **Appendices (A–D)**: Currently stubs. Need mathematical formalizations, detailed protocols, comparative analyses, and annotated bibliography.

2. **Implementation Patterns (8.2)**: Marked as future expansion. Requires real-world case studies and failure mode analysis.

3. **Figure Assets**: Figure 1 (Triadic Silos) and Figure 2 (Fool's Cycle) referenced but diagrams not yet created.

4. **Citation Expansion**: Full bibliography formatting needed. Current placeholders in citation-stubs.md require full APA/Chicago formatting.

5. **NEXUS/Kybernōsis Mapping (8.1)**: Section-specific cross-references to codices need to be added.
