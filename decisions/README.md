## 🎯 Purpose and Goals

### **Why DADS Exists for ask.report**
- **Decision Traceability**: Track the evolution of architectural choices for the ASK platform
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain the "why" behind mobile-first and UI/UX decisions
- **Impact Assessment**: Understand how decisions affect project direction and user experience
- **Team Alignment**: Ensure all agents (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT) understand decision rationale
- **Historical Learning**: Build institutional memory about what works for ask.report's specific needs

### **DADS Integration with ask.report Systems**
- **Project Plan**: Decisions inform and constrain task creation in project-plan folders
- **Issues Tracking**: Issues often lead to architectural decisions
- **Asset Management**: Decisions guide UI/UX asset creation and organization
- **Agent Coordination**: Decisions guide agent handoff specifications; use agent-coms inbox/outbox messaging for directed notifications and summaries (see `agent-coms/README.md` and `agent-coms/message-template.md`).
