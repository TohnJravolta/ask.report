## Context
Keyboard bindings not functioning on ask.report - broken functionality that needs fixing. Mobile hamburger menu confirmed working. This is a simple functionality fix to restore keyboard shortcuts.

## Issue Details
- **Root Cause**: Keyboard event listeners not properly bound or functioning
- **Impact**: Users cannot use keyboard shortcuts on ask.report
- **User Report**: "keyboard bindings no longer work" on ask.report
- **Scope**: Desktop keyboard functionality issue

## Action Required
1. **Locate keyboard binding implementation** - Find current keyboard event listener setup
2. **Debug keyboard event handling** - Identify why keyboard events not firing
3. **Fix keyboard bindings** - Restore keyboard shortcut functionality
4. **Test functionality** - Validate keyboard shortcuts work as expected

## Technical Requirements
- Fix keyboard event listener binding and event handling
- Restore proper keyboard shortcut functionality
- Add defensive programming for missing event handlers
- Ensure keyboard shortcuts work reliably

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All keyboard shortcuts functional
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation works throughout interface
- [ ] Focus management follows accessibility best practices
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Cross-browser keyboard compatibility confirmed

## Testing Requirements
- Test keyboard-only navigation through entire interface
- Validate all keyboard shortcuts work as expected
- Ensure proper focus indicators and tab order
- Cross-browser keyboard functionality validation

## Links/Paths
- Progress tracker: `C:/Users/jarde/Documents/projects/ASK/ask.report/repo/MASTER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`
- Research institute focus: Supporting accessibility for academic research interface

## Due / Priority
**HIGH** - Keyboard accessibility is important for research institute accessibility goals and inclusive design principles.

## Completion Actions
1. Update issue status to resolved
2. Document keyboard accessibility improvements
3. Update documentation with keyboard shortcuts
4. Ensure accessibility compliance documented

## Notes
This supports ask.report's mission as a research institute platform by ensuring accessibility for all users. Focus on keyboard accessibility as part of inclusive design, not mobile-specific development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All keyboard bindings functional
- Keyboard-only navigation works throughout interface
- Accessibility standards met for research institute users
- Documentation updated with keyboard shortcuts
- Implementation tested and documented
