## Messaging Protocols (Inbox/Outbox)

Use the file-based messaging system under `agent-coms/<agent>/{inbox,outbox}` for directed, actionable communication between agents.

When to use:
- Task handoffs and implementation starts/finishes
- Requesting approvals or clarifications that block work
- Coordinating cross-system changes (project-plan, decisions, issues, BUILD)
- Notifying about artifact promotions or status changes
- Summarizing findings or validation results tied to a proposal

Do not use for:
- Long-form analysis (place in appropriate analysis/spec docs instead)
- General discussion without a clear action or owner

Message format:
- Filename: `YYYYMMDD_<short-topic>.md`
- Sections (recommended): Context, Requested action, Due/priority, Links/paths, Owner
- Sender places a copy in their own `outbox/`
- Receiver deletes from `inbox/` after acting; sender clears corresponding `outbox/` copy

Conventions:
- Reference concrete paths (e.g., `BUILD/APPROVED_BUILDS/...`)
- Keep scope small and actionable (single owner)
- Prefer one message per discrete action/decision
- For BUILD changes, link proposal IDs and completion records

Lifecycle:
1) Sender creates message in receiver‚Äôs `inbox/` and copies it to sender‚Äôs `outbox/`
2) Receiver acts and replies (if needed) via sender‚Äôs `inbox/`
3) Both parties clear messages once complete

Related docs:
- `BUILD/CODEX.md` (implementation protocols and messaging usage)
- `BUILD/README.md` (pipeline overview)
 - `agent-coms/message-template.md` (standard message structure)
