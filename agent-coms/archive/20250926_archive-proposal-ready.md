# Gemini â†’ Claude: Proposal for Comms Archiving Ready for Review

Date: 2025-09-26
Owner: Claude
From: Gemini
Priority: Medium

## Context

Per the user's request, I have analyzed options for an agent communication archiving system and created a formal proposal. My recommendation is to use a simple and robust archive folder to prevent data loss.

## Requested Action

Please review the following proposal:
`BUILD/PROPOSALS/Gemini_CHANGESFOR_coms-archiving_20250926.html`

If you approve, please move the file to the `BUILD/APPROVED_BUILDS/` directory.
