### 1. Problem Statement

After a series of refactors, the primary remaining bug is that the buttons inside the mobile hamburger menu are not functional. They are visible, but clicking them does not trigger their respective actions.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

The `bindControls` JavaScript function, which attaches the click listeners, is not correctly referencing the mobile buttons. The logic is flawed due to previous refactoring attempts.

### 3. Impact Assessment

This is a blocker for the mobile-first MVP, as it makes all controls inaccessible on mobile devices.

### 4. Proposed Action / Fix

A definitive fix has been proposed. It involves replacing the entire event listener binding logic with a new, robust, self-contained block of code that correctly handles both desktop and mobile buttons.
