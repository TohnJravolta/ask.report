# Long-Horizon: Instructions

**Objective:** To explore and document strategic ideas without the pressure of immediate implementation.

1.  **Creation**: Anyone (human or agent) can propose a long-horizon issue.
2.  **Discussion**: These topics will be discussed during monthly or quarterly strategic planning reviews.
3.  **Research**: If an idea is deemed promising, an agent may be assigned to a time-boxed research or prototyping spike.
4.  **Outcome**: The outcome of a long-horizon issue is not necessarily a feature. It could be a recommendation, a prototype, a research summary, or a decision to defer the idea. Issues are typically moved to `archive/` rather than `deprecated-or-fixed/`.
