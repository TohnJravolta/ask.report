# Short-Horizon: Instructions

**Objective:** Rapid triage and resolution.

1.  **Creation**: As soon as a critical bug or blocker is found, create a new issue file here.
2.  **Triage (Gemini)**: Within 24 hours, review the issue, set its priority, and assign it to an implementation agent.
3.  **Resolution**: The assigned agent should immediately begin work. Progress should be logged daily in the "Resolution Log."
4.  **Validation**: Once the fix is implemented, it must be validated by another agent or the human lead to confirm it resolves the issue and introduces no new regressions.
5.  **Closure**: After validation, Gemini will move the issue file to the `deprecated-or-fixed/` directory.
