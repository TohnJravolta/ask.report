# Short-Horizon: Scope Guide

**Timeline:** Days to ~2 Weeks

**Focus:** Immediate resolution of high-impact issues, blockers, and bugs related to the current milestone.

### Criteria for this Horizon:

- **Blockers:** Anything preventing the completion of the current milestone (e.g., the mobile-first MVP).
- **Critical Bugs:** Regressions or major functional errors that severely impact the user experience (e.g., rendering failures, layout crashes).
- **UI/UX Polish:** Small but essential fixes required to meet the quality standards for the current release.
- **Performance Dips:** Any new change that causes a noticeable drop below the target ~60fps.

### Examples for `ask.report` MVP:

- A CSS bug causing the control buttons to overlap on an iPhone viewport.
- The `speed` slider being unresponsive to touch input.
- A JavaScript error that prevents the `Help` modal from opening on mobile.
- An issue where the on-screen keyboard covers the input field when typing a query.
