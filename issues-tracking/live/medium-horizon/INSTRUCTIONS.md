# Medium-Horizon: Instructions

**Objective:** Structured development of major features and resolution of complex issues.

1.  **Creation**: Issues are typically created during planning sessions and correspond to items in the main project plan.
2.  **Analysis (Gemini/Owner)**: The issue owner is responsible for completing the "Technical Analysis / Design" section. This serves as the specification for the work.
3.  **Implementation**: Once the design is approved, the work is scheduled into a development cycle. Progress is tracked against the "Acceptance Criteria."
4.  **Validation**: The completed work must be validated against the acceptance criteria by the lead agent or human lead.
5.  **Closure**: Once validated, the issue is moved to the `deprecated-or-fixed/` directory.
