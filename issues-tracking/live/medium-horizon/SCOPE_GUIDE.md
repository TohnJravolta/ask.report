# Medium-Horizon: Scope Guide

**Timeline:** Weeks to ~2 Months

**Focus:** Important, non-blocking issues that require research, planning, and design. This is where we will track the tasks for the v1 AI backend integration.

### Criteria for this Horizon:

- **V1 Features:** All tasks related to the AI backend integration (e.g., API development, model integration).
- **Significant Refactoring:** Planned technical debt pay-down or code restructuring that is not urgent.
- **Complex Bugs:** Non-critical bugs that require significant investigation.
- **New Feature Exploration:** Initial technical design and prototyping for features planned for the next major version.

### Examples for `ask.report` v1:

- Design and implement the `/api/query` endpoint.
- Choose and integrate a serverless hosting platform.
- Develop the frontend logic to handle the "thinking" state while waiting for an AI response.
- Research and prototype a generative audio system based on the Novelty Engine.
